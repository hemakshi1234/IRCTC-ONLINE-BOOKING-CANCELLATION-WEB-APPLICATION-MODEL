<h3 align="left">About the Project</h3>

In the existing system Reservation is done manually by a user at railway reservation
counters. User has to wait for a long time in the queue to get the reservation. This wasted
the time of user and for this lot of man power is required. and lot of paper work is also
required.

To avoid all the above pitfalls the system proposed is **“Railway Online
Booking/Cancellation Web Application Model”**. In this , all the reservation process is
done through online from any place in the world. This web application saves money,
manpower, time.
The basic functions being performed by my web application model are maintaining
records ,booking and cancellation. These functions are described as follows:-
* It reserves or books and cancels seats of passenger (using booking master and
booking history).
* It contains information and data about the stations ( in station master).
* It contains information and data about the trains (train master).
* It contains information about the passenger (in user master).
* It contains the details of reservations fare or the train fare (in train fare).
* It makes entries for reservation, cancelled tickets.
* It will update for details of trains.
* The passenger could search for trains from a particular source to destination
* The record of train status includes dates for which tickets can be booked, total
number of seats available, number of seats already booked.
